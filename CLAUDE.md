# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a water quality monitoring application that has been migrated from a Dash-based monolithic Python application to a modern Flask REST API backend with a React frontend architecture.

The repository contains two main applications:
- **Flask Backend** (`/flask/`): REST API server providing data endpoints for water quality analytics
- **React Frontend** (`/react/frontend/`): Modern React SPA consuming the Flask API

## Development Commands

### Flask Backend Development
```bash
# From /flask/ directory
python app.py                    # Run development server
python debug_flask.py            # Run with enhanced debugging
python test_api_quick.py         # Quick API health check
python test_comprehensive_api.py # Full API test suite
python final_api_test.py         # Complete integration tests
```

### React Frontend Development  
```bash
# From /react/frontend/ directory
npm run dev                      # Start development server (Vite)
npm run build                    # Build for production
npm run preview                  # Preview production build
npm run lint                     # Run ESLint
npm run test                     # Run Vitest tests
npm run test:run                 # Run tests once
npm run test:coverage            # Run tests with coverage
```

### Testing
- Flask tests: Run Python test files directly from `/flask/` directory
- React tests: Uses Vitest with React Testing Library, configured in `vitest.config.js`

## Architecture

### Flask Backend (`/flask/`)
- **Entry Point**: `app.py` - Main Flask application factory
- **API Blueprints**: `/api/` - RESTful endpoints organized by domain (auth, water_quality, alerts, reports, etc.)
- **Services**: `/services/` - Business logic layer (auth_service, core_data_service, alert_engine, etc.)
- **Configuration**: `/config/` - Database, logging, and application settings
- **Utilities**: `/utils/` - Performance optimization, caching, error handling, data processing

Key Flask features:
- CORS configured for React frontend on localhost:5173
- Token-based authentication with Flask-Login
- Comprehensive error handling with JSON responses
- Advanced logging and performance monitoring
- Security headers and CSP policies
- Serves React build files from `/react/frontend/dist/`

### React Frontend (`/react/frontend/src/`)
- **Entry Point**: `main.jsx` - Application bootstrap with React Router
- **App Component**: `App.jsx` - Main application with routing and authentication
- **Pages**: `/pages/` - Route components (Home, WaterQuality, SiteComparison, etc.)
- **Components**: `/components/` - Reusable UI components
- **Services**: `/services/api.js` - Axios-based API client for Flask backend
- **Contexts**: `/contexts/` - React Context for authentication state
- **Hooks**: `/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for data fetching

Key React features:
- Built with Vite for fast development
- Uses React Bootstrap for UI components
- Plotly.js integration for data visualization
- Protected routes with authentication context
- Progressive data loading and error boundaries

### API Structure
All Flask endpoints follow `/api/v1/{domain}` pattern:
- `/api/v1/auth/` - Authentication (login, logout, status)
- `/api/v1/water_quality/data` - Water quality measurements
- `/api/v1/site_comparison/data` - Cross-site analysis
- `/api/v1/redox_analysis/data` - Redox potential analysis
- `/api/v1/alerts/data` - Alert management
- `/api/v1/reports/` - Report generation
- `/api/v1/performance/` - System performance metrics

### Data Flow
1. React components use hooks to fetch data from Flask API via `api.js`
2. Flask blueprints process requests and interact with services layer
3. Services layer handles business logic and database operations
4. Core data service (`core_data_service.py`) manages database queries
5. Caching layer optimizes repeated data requests

### Authentication
- Flask-Login manages server-side sessions
- React AuthContext provides client-side auth state
- Protected routes require authentication
- User roles control access to admin features

## Configuration Files

- `flask/config/settings.py` - Site definitions and water quality parameters
- `react/frontend/vite.config.js` - Vite build configuration
- `react/frontend/vitest.config.js` - Test runner configuration  
- `react/frontend/eslint.config.js` - Linting rules
- `flask/config/database.py` - Database connection management
- `flask/config/advanced_logging_config.py` - Centralized logging setup

## Key Integration Points

- Flask serves React build files for production deployment
- API base URL configured in `api.js` (http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1)
- CORS allows React dev server (localhost:5173) to access Flask API
- Shared session cookies enable authentication across both applications

**Status**: ✅ ALL ISSUES COMPLETELY RESOLVED  
**Documentation**: `/REDOX_ANALYSIS_PERFORMANCE_FIX.md`

1. ✅ **Inefficient Data Fetching (Duplicate API Requests)** - RESOLVED
   - Root cause: Two separate useEffect hooks triggering simultaneous API calls on page load
   - Solution: Consolidated to single debounced data fetching pattern
   - Result: 50% reduction in API calls, faster initial page render

2. ✅ **Flawed Debouncing Implementation** - RESOLVED  
   - Root cause: Multiple setTimeout calls without proper cleanup causing queued API requests
   - Solution: Proper debounce implementation with cleanup on each change
   - Result: Smooth user interactions, no backend overload

3. ✅ **Suppressed React Warnings (exhaustive-deps)** - RESOLVED
   - Root cause: ESLint warnings disabled hiding potential React bugs
   - Solution: Proper dependency array management with fetchData included
   - Result: 0 React warnings, improved code maintainability

4. ✅ **Hardcoded Date Limitation (CRITICAL)** - RESOLVED
   - Root cause: Backend hardcoded to never show data past May 31, 2024
   - Solution: Dynamic date calculation using `datetime.now()`
   - Result: Users can now access data up to current date

5. ✅ **Flawed Data Downsampling Fallback Logic** - RESOLVED
   - Root cause: Peak/valley detection included center point in comparison window
   - Solution: Fixed fallback logic to exclude center point from neighbor comparison  
   - Result: Accurate chart representation when scipy unavailable

#### **🔴 CRITICAL: Water Quality Analysis Page Issues (7/7 Issues Fixed)**
**Status**: ✅ ALL ISSUES COMPLETELY RESOLVED  
**Documentation**: `/WATER_QUALITY_PERFORMANCE_FIX.md`

   - Result: Current data access instead of July 2025 cutoff

9. ✅ **Flawed Data Downsampling Logic** - RESOLVED  
   - Fixed identical peak/valley detection issue as Redox Analysis
   - Result: Accurate visualizations regardless of scipy availability

10. ✅ **Inconsistent Error Response Format** - RESOLVED
    - Root cause: Plain dictionary returned instead of JSON response
    - Solution: Fixed with proper `jsonify()` formatting
    - Result: Consistent error handling, no frontend parsing failures

11. ✅ **Improper React Patterns (localStorage & Navigation)** - RESOLVED
    - Root cause: Direct browser API usage violating React patterns
    - Solution: Custom `useLocalStorage` hook and React Router navigation
    - Result: Professional React patterns with error handling
